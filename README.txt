OkalRelRef is a demo site for Lynda's students at BCIT to experience github. And for Lynda to experiment with hand-coded ideas for semantic application of HTML/CSS to content, with little or no programming concerned.

The content features background on characters, settings and fictional history of the Okal Rel Universe, a scifi universe founded by Lynda's 10-novel Okal Rel Saga, originally published by Edge Science Fiction and Fantasy. As of 2013 Lynda owns the IP for the series and related works and is managing them through Reality Skimming Press.

OkalRelRef is a demo site for Lynda's students taking COMP 1950 at BCIT to experience github.
The content features background on characters, settings and fictional history of the Okal Rel Universe, a scifi universe founded by Lynda's 10-novel Okal Rel Saga, originally published by Edge Science Fiction and Fantasy. As of 2013 Lynda owns the IP for the series and related works and is managing them through Reality Skimming Press.

This site is co-maintained by Kyle Davidson, marketing manager and webmaster guru for Reality Skimming Press.

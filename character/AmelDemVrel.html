    <div class="intro">Too kind and too beautiful for his own good, Amel is the prince raised as a pauper. He rises to power on both the secular and religious front by the end of the series, and struggles against his traumatic early experiences and impossible ideals to find real, imperfect love. While not much of a fighter, he is an instinctive genius with info science and develops into a better politician than he ever imagined once he grasps his mission is to help Sevildom adapt to change. And, of course, there's his reputation as a lover to live down ... or up to, depending on the culture involved.</div> <!-- end intro -->
